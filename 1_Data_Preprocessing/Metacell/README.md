# Metacell
- The metacell process is included in the Metacell folder
- Description: In scATAC-seq data, the sparsity means not all cell fragments are present in every region, resulting in many zeros in the matrix. This can lower correlation coefficients between regions. To mitigate this, we use metacells. A metacell aggregates similar cells, increasing data density and improving analysis.
- Employs the [SEACells](https://github.com/dpeerlab/SEACells) project.
- For detail of the theory, SEACells has the [publication in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01716-9).
- Metacell.ipynb contains the code of metacell process.
- Input is provided in metacell_input_data folder which is generated by binning process
- Metalcell output is saved in metacell_output folder

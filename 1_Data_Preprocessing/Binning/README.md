# Binning
- The binning process is included in the Binning folder.
- Description: Binning involves segmenting the genome into equal-sized bins to facilitate analysis of chromatin accessibility.
- Utilizes the [ArchR](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/ArchR) project for binning.
- Binning size: 0.5 million.
- For detail of the theory, ArchR has the [publication in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00790-6).
- The main script is using R language running the ArchR project.
- The script is provided in Binning-ArchR-preprocessing-binSize-0.5M.R
- The terminal output is provided in Terminal-output-Binning-ArchR.html
- The output data is saved in Binning_output folder
